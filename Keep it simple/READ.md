Principle
KISS
Keep it simple, stupid

Overview
Keep it simple (KISS) emphasizes simplicity in design and coding. The goal is to keep the code straightforward and easy to understand, avoiding unnecessary complexity. Simple code is easier to read, debug, maintain, reuse, and extend.

Key concepts
Readability: Code should be easy to read and understand. If a new developer looks at the code he should be able to grasp it without looking at comprehensive comments or explanations.

Maintainability: Simple code is easier to maintain, less prone to bugs, and easier to debug if an issue arises.

Efficiency: Simple code can be more efficient because it can avoid overhead that comes with complex logic and structure.

Modularity: Breaking down complex problems into smaller, manageable pieces helps maintain simplicity.

Additional tips for Keeping it Simple

Use descriptive names: Choose clear and descriptive names for variables, functions, and classes to make your code self documenting.
Avoid deep nesting: Refactor deeply nested code into smaller functions or methods.
Limit the number of parameters: Keep the function parameters to a minimum, if a function requires a lot of parameters consider grouping them in an object.
Modularize your code: Break your code into small, reusable functions or classes. Each function or class should have a single responsibility.
Comment sparingly: Write code that is self explanatory, use comments to explain why something is done, not what is done.
